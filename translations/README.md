# Translations

This folder contains translation files for the Sensor Logger app. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve translations and make the app accessible to more users worldwide.

Note that not all screens in the app are translatable. Sections aimed at power users remain in English, while screens and workflows for common users and study participants are covered by these translation files.

## Important Note on AI Translations

The translations in this folder were initially generated using AI. While AI translation provides a good starting point, it may not always capture the nuances, technical terminology, or natural phrasing that native speakers would use. Your help in refining these translations is greatly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository** and create a new branch for your changes.

2. **Edit the relevant JSON file** for your language. Each file contains key-value pairs where the key is an identifier and the value is the translated string.

3. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description of the changes you've made.

### Tips for Contributors

- The English translation file (`en.json`) is the source of truth.
- Focus on improving naturalness and accuracy of translations.
- Pay attention to technical terms related to sensors and data logging.
- Keep translations concise where possible, as UI space may be limited.
- Keep brand names in English: Sensor Logger, Sensor Logger Cloud, Pro, Ultimate, Plus.
- Keep technical identifiers in English: HTTP, MQTT, GPS, WiFi, USB, API, JSON, CSV, KML, ZIP, SQLite, Excel, SSID, BSSID, MAC, IPv4, IPv6, NTP, QR, PDF, UTC.
- If you're unsure about a translation, feel free to leave a comment in your PR.

## Release Process

Once your Pull Request is reviewed and merged, your translation improvements will be included in one of the next releases of Sensor Logger. We batch translation updates together, so there may be some time between your contribution being merged and it appearing in the app.

Thank you for helping make Sensor Logger more accessible!
