# One-Page Unit Reference

This page is a comprehensive documentation of the units of values reported in the Sensor Logger app. Much effort has been spent to ensure correctness and consistency across iOS and Android. Should you notice any error, please report by making an Issue or make a pull request directly. Additional information about sensors and measurements is available in-app by tapping the "eye" icon next to each sensor.

## Time
- `time` is in nanoseconds since epoch. For more information about conversion, use tools like https://www.epochconverter.com/. 
- `seconds_elapsed` is in seconds since the start of the recording.

## Accelerometer
- `x`, `y` and `z` in meters per second squared (ms<sup>-2</sup>); Assumes `g` to be 9.80665ms<sup>-2</sup>.

See the [Coordinates Reference](https://github.com/tszheichoi/awesome-sensor-logger/blob/main/COORDINATES.md) for definitions of axes. 

## Accelerometer Uncalibrated
- `x`, `y` and `z`:
    - On iOS, this is in [standard gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravity) (g), when "Standardise Units & Frames" is off (default). The unit is ms<sup>-2</sup> when "Standardise Units & Frames" is on. 
    - On Android, this is in meters per second squared (ms<sup>-2</sup>).

## Gravity
- `x`, `y` and `z`, in meters per second squared (ms<sup>-2</sup>); Assumes `g` to be 9.80665ms<sup>-2</sup>.

## Gyroscope
- `x`, `y` and `z`, in radians per second (rad/s).

## Gyroscope Uncalibrated
- `x`, `y` and `z`, in radians per second (rad/s).

## Orientation
- `pitch`, `roll` and `yaw`, in radians.
- `qx`, `qy`, `qz` and `qw`, dimensionless.

See the [Coordinates Reference](https://github.com/tszheichoi/awesome-sensor-logger/blob/main/COORDINATES.md) for definitions of axes. Note that the `yaw` definition is different between iOS and Android.

## Pedometer
- `steps` is an integer.  

## Location
- `altitude`, in meters as a height above the WGS84 ellipsoid.
- `altitudeAboveMeanSeaLevel`, in meters above mean sea level (iOS Only). 
- `bearing`, in degrees from 0 to 360 relative to due north. Negative values indicate it is invalid. 
- `bearingAccuracy`, in degrees. Negative values indicate it is invalid. 
- `horizontalAcccuracy`, in meters as the radius of uncertainty. It is approximately the unit standard deviation around the `altitude`. Negative values indicate it is invalid.
- `verticalAccuracy`, in meters. It is approximately the unit standard deviation around the `altitude`. Negative values indicate it is invalid. 
- `speed`, in meters per second. Negative values indicate it is invalid. Note this is derived from the location, so may be unreliable if the speed changes between location updates. 
- `speedAccuracy`, in meters per second. Negative values indicate it is invalid.
- `latitude`, in degrees. Positive values are north of the equator (-90 to 90)
- `longitude`, in degrees. Positive values are east of the meridian line (-180 to 180).

## Magnetometer
- `x`, `y` and `z`, in micro teslas.

## Uncalibrated Magnetometer
- `x`, `y` and `z`, in micro teslas.

## Barometer
- `relativeAltitude` is in meters since the start of the recording.
- `pressure` is in mBar.

## Microphone
- `dBFS` is [decibels relative to full scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBFS) and is dimensionless.

- `gravityX`, `gravityY` and `gravityZ`, in meters per second squared (ms<sup>-2</sup>); Assumes `g` to be 9.80665ms<sup>-2</sup>, regardless of whether "Standardise Units & Frames" is turned on or not.
