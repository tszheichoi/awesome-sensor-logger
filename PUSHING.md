# Data Pushing
Sensor Logger supports HTTP Push and MQTT Publishing during a recording session. This can be enabled by tapping the gear icon on the Logger page. All supported sensors during a recording will be streamed in JSON, once every configurable batch period, to the specified web server / broker via the specified protocol.

Both HTTP Push and MQTT have the same schema, configurable batching period and supported sensors. The only difference is the protocol. HTTP has a simpler setup and is more widely supported. On the other hand, MQTT is more lightweight and popular for IoT applications. Sensor Logger also supports simultaneous HTTP pushing and MQTT publishing. 

If you want to push to other protocols currently not supported by Sensor Logger, many managed MQTT brokers support out-of-the-box data forwarding to pretty much anything. For example, [EMQ X Cloud Data Integration](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/latest/data-integration/data-bridges.html) supports message forwarding to Kafka, and GCP PubSub Sources.

## HTTP Push
For HTTP Push, you have to set up a web server to receive the messages. For more information and sample code on how to set one up, see https://github.com/tszheichoi/awesome-sensor-logger?tab=readme-ov-file#live-data-streaming.

## MQTT Publishing
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol that is widely used for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It is more lightweight than HTTP, but requires a more involved setup. 

### Setting Up a Managed Broker
You can either run your own broker (e.g. Mosquitto, EMQX, HiveMQ, RabbitMQ, and VerneMQ), or use a managed and hosted one.

#### HiveMQ Cloud Example
For this example, we will use HiveMQ Cloud, which is free to use and does not require you to install anything on your computer. 

1. Visit https://www.hivemq.com/company/get-hivemq/ and then select HiveMQ Cloud. You will need to create a free account.
2. Select the free Serverless option.
3. Select AWS as the provider. A cluster will then be provisioned for you.
4. Navigate to Access Management at the top.
5. Create a username and password under the Credentials section. 

Copy the Broker URL, Username and Password as shown below. Make sure Use TLS is toggled on. You can change the topic name as you wish. The default is `sensor-logger`.

To test the connection, navigate to the Web Client at the top on HiveMQ. Connect to the client via the same username and password you have just created. Then, enter the topic you have configured on Sensor Logger. It is `sensor-logger` by default. On Sensor Logger, tap "Tap to Test Publish". If successful, it should say "Message Sent". On the web client, you should see an incoming test message.

It is also via this web client that you can see incoming messages during a recording session when MQTT Publishing is enabled.

#### EMQX Cloud Example
EMQX Cloud works very similarly to HiveHQ Cloud, and also provides a generous free tier for you to try things out. 

1. Sign up for a new account at https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud.
2. Choose and deploy the Serverless plan.
3. Select the newly created cluster in the Deployments.
4. Create a username and password under the Credentials section. 

Copy the Broker URL, Username and Password as shown below. Make sure Use TLS is toggled on. You can change the topic name as you wish. The default is `sensor-logger`. 
<img width="866" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 16 47 24" src="https://github.com/tszheichoi/awesome-sensor-logger/assets/30114997/a88ac1da-0fa5-4a0e-ab27-bdbcea0c7328">

To test the connection, navigate to the Online Test section in the sidebar and enter the Topic the same as that as configured in Sensor Logger. Then click Subscribe. On Sensor Logger, tap "Tap to Test Publish". If successful, it should say "Message Sent". On the web client, you should see an incoming test message.  

### Setting Up a Local Broker
You can also run EMQX locally if you do not want to use one of the managed cloud services. In this case, unless you expose your IP address, Sensor Logger should be on the same local network as your machine. 

#### EMQX Locally Using Docker
1. Install docker on your machine https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
2. Get the docker image for EMQX following [these instructions](https://www.emqx.io/downloads). Specifically, run `docker pull emqx/emqx:5.6.0`.
3. Start the container `docker run -d --name emqx -p 1883:1883 -p 8083:8083 -p 8084:8084 -p 8883:8883 -p 18083:18083 emqx/emqx:5.6.0`.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:18083/` on a browser. The default username and password are `admin` and `public`, which you can change.
5. Select Authentication from the sidebar and then click `+ Create`. Follow the workflow to create to create a Password-Based authentication. For most options, such as the backend and encryption mechanism, the defaults are fine.
6. Select Websocket Client in the sidebar. There, you should find the host and port number you should enter into Sensor Logger.
7. On that same page, you can connect and subscribe to the `sensor-logger` topic for testing. 

### Publishing to the Broker
Once you have setup your broker, you can toggle "Enable MQTT Publish" on and start a recording session as usual. The JSON schema for the published MQTT messages is the same as the HTTP Push ones, namely: 

```
{
    messageId: 0,
    sessionId: "identifier",
    deviceId: "identifier",
    payload: [
        {
            "name": "accelerometer",
            "time": 1698501144401773000,
            <other fields depending on sensor>
        },
        {
            "name": "location",
            "time": 1698501145514000000,
            <other fields depending on sensor>
        },
    ],
}
```
The `messageId` is incremented for each message sent. The `sessionId` is the same for all messages in a single recording, and the `deviceId` is the same for all messages from a single device. The time is in UTC epoch nanoseconds.

Further, note the following:
- Sensor Logger publishes with a quality of service level 0 (at most once).
- Sensor Logger supports both websockets and TCP. Typically websockets are on port 8000 (no TLS) or 8884 (TLS). Typically TCP connections are on port 1883 (no TLS) or 8883 (TLS).

### Real-Time Visualization
A simple web based demo app is available at https://github.com/tszheichoi/sensor-logger-streaming-demo-app. It connects to an MQTT broker, consumes streaming data, and visualizes it in an interactive plot. The demo also illustrates how to handle data from multiple devices simultaneously.

### Consuming From the Broker
Once your measurements have reached the broker, it is up to you how to use those messages. Typically, you would set up another client to consume these messages. As an example, you can do this via Python. 
```
pip install paho-mqtt
```
Then you can adapt the following Python script for your use cases. 
```
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

BROKER_URL = "your_broker.com"
BROKER_PORT = 8884
USERNAME = "your_username"
PASSWORD = "your_password"

def on_connect(*args):
    print(f"Connected with result code {args[3]}")
    client.subscribe("sensor-logger")

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(f"msg: {msg.topic} {msg.payload}")

client = mqtt.Client(mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2, transport="websockets")
client.username_pw_set(username=USERNAME, password=PASSWORD)
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message
client.tls_set(tls_version=mqtt.ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
client.connect(BROKER_URL, BROKER_PORT, 60)
client.loop_forever()
```
See the HTTP Push documentation for an example of how to plot the sensor data live using Plotly Dash.
